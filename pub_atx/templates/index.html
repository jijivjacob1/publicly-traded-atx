                This site gives you the opportunity to take an in-depth look at Austin's business environment.
                It details financial data of the city's top 31 publicly traded companies.  Visitors are able to explore
                trading, revenue, market cap data, and much more.  The purpose is to provide tools to explore and
                learn about the Austin economy through the lens of its largest companies.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: normal">
                The primary data source for this project was a company metadata from the
                <strong><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/" style="color: black"> Austin Business Journal</a></strong>.  That information was
                supplemented with data from <strong><a href="https://www.quandl.com/" style="color: black"> Quandl </a></strong> and
                <strong><a href="https://iextrading.com/" style="color: black"> IEX</a></strong>.

                    Many people have preconceived ideas about the Austin economy. Most see it as a high-tech mecca, much like Silicon Valley
                    in California.  In many ways, those assumptions are accurate.  Tech giants such as Apple, IBM, and Google
                    all have large offices in the Austin area.  The city is also home to various tech starts including HomeAway and WP Engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Austin's economy has so much more to offer.  The chart below gives you the opportunity
                    to explore the city's public companies from three different angles.  Each box represents one of the 31
                    companies with global headquarters in Austin.  You can use the buttons below the chart to toggle views.

            First, look at them scaled by market capitalization (total outstanding shares * market value per share).
            This will give you a view of which companies have the greatest overall value. You can also look at them
            scaled by the largest employers in the Austin market. This will show you the direct impact these companies
            have in our local economy as job creators. Lastly, look at them scaled by total employee base. This will
            give you a feel for the number of employees outside of Austin and the impact of these businesses on other economies.

                  Austin is a community that is known for its traffic.  This map shows the
                  location of all the publicly traded companies.  This is an opportunity
                  to look clustering of business types.  The hot spots are
                  downtown Austin and the North Austin area known as The Domain.

                  The bubble chart below provides a visual representation of Austin's
                  diverse economy.  The bubble size represents the total number of employees
                  at each company and the color represents the industry.  While the
                  tech industry is well represented, the chart shows how the drivers of Austin's
                  economy are spread across seven different industries.

             Three of the companies that stand out from this chart are Parsley Energy,
             American Campus Communities, and Chuy's.  Parsely Energy is one of the
             smallest companies by total employees, but the largest by market cap.
             American Campus Communities was founded in 1993 and is the nation's largest
             developer, owner, and manager of high-quality student apartments.
             Chuy's is one of the smallest by market cap, but the company employs 8,200
             employees across the United States including almost 900 in Austin.

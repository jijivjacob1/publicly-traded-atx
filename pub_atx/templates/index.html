            </h1>
            <p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                We would like to give you an opportunity to look at the Austin business environment (as defined by the top 31 publicly traded
                companies) and explore the past 3 years of trading data, revenue and market cap data. Our desire is to give
                you a sandbox to play in that will help you better understand the health of our local economy vis a vis our
                publicly traded companies.
                Our primary data source was a csv file from Austin Business Journal.  We expanded on this data, pulling from Quandl and IEX.

                    Many people have preconceived ideas about the Austin economy. Some see us as a high-tech mecca, much like Silicon Valley
                    in California. However, this chart will give you the opportunity to view our public companies along 3
                    different scales. Each box represents one of the 31 companies. Look at them scaled by market capitalization
                    (total outstanding shares * market value per share). This will give you a view of which companies have
                    the greatest overall value. You can also look at them scaled by the largest employers in the Austin market.
                    This will show you the direct impact these companies have in our local economy as job creators. Lastly,
                    look at them scaled by total employee base. This will give you a feel for the number of employees outside
                    of Austin and the impact of these businesses on other economies. </p>

                  Austin is a community that is known for its traffic.  This map shows you
                  the location of all the publicly traded companies.  This is an opportunity
                  to see if you see any clustering of business types.  The hot spots are
                  downtown Austin and the North Austin area known as The Domain. </p>
